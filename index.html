                        <p>Arthur Dent starts his day with his house being torn down to make room for a road.  From there, things only take a further turn for the worse as Vogons, an alien construction crew, show up to demolish the planet Earth to make room for an intergalactic highway.  Luckily, his best friend Ford Prefect, a cleverly disguised alien, who has been stranded on Earth for the past 15 years as he writes a revised guide to the galaxy, is able to save him from the demise of the human race by hitching a ride on one of the Vogon ships.  After a rather improbable meeting with Ford’s semi-cousin and president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the party heads off on a journey to find the mythical planet Magrathea.  Armed with the knowledge contained within the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an improbability drive, a depressed robot, and a towel, Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Trillian set off deeper into space.</p>

                        <p>In the words of Neil Gaiman, Douglas Adam was a very tall, clumsy, and cheerful person.  Someone who, while exceptionally good at writing, seemed to hate it the more he did it.  He was a genius who not only saw the world differently but was also able to communicate his thoughts.  Born in 1952 in Cambridge, England, Adams was a self-proclaimed “strange child”.  Douglas Noel Adams was an English author, screenwriter, essayist, humorist, satirist, and dramatist.  The concept of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy first came to fruition after a copious amount of drinking while stargazing.  Yet, the idea was forgotten until years later.  He followed this success with The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980); Life, The Universe and Everything (1982); So Long and Thanks for all the Fish (1984); and Mostly Harmless (1992).  Douglas died unexpectedly in May 2001 of a sudden heart attack.</p>
